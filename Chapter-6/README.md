### Note: ###

Here, we redefined **GameHelper** classâ€”it has the same class name as that in `../Chapter-5`. If you are using some advanced editor (e.g., VS Code) or IDE, and have compiled `../Chapter-5/GameHelper.java` before, `DotComBust.java` and `DotComTestDrive.java` might fail to compile. If so, please configure the *Classpath*, or just use a pure *terminal* rather than the IDE or editor.
